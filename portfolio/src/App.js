        I am a Business analyst and a software developer, who likes to understand and watch things closely. I believe in the fact that we should make our decisions after having a good knowledge about a subject. Meaningful communication always leads to a successful project and I always try to establish the same. I am an energetic, optimistic and self motivated fellow. I have gone through a lot of failures and convoluted scenarios. The most beautiful part of those painful times is that I gained new insights from them and it changed my perceptions about life. Innovative ideas pave the path for change in the world, I always try to analyze and approach situations in different ways. Sometimes it may lead to failure, but I always believe in the fact that failures are the basic steps to success.

I am a huge fan of Elon Musk and how he brings his innovative ideas to reality. One of his quotes that inspired me is 
“"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."”
I always try to uphold this motto everyday in my life. The greatest obstacle a person faces is to work on things he wants to grow in a consistent manner. We should always try to find the time to put input towards the goals we want to achieve in our life. I always try to break my long term goals to short milestones, this will help you to learn and enjoy the path you are taking towards your destiny.

        I worked as a software engineer for 5 years at Qbusrst technologies. Qburst is the place where I
moulded myself and it officially marked the starting of my professional career. As a newbie, I
got a lot of support and guidance from the experienced and refined professionals in Qburst
technologies.
<br></br>
<br></br>
I started as an associate Engineer in Fasttrack a Honeywell project for inventory management
with a small team of 3 members. Small teams always help to get a lot of exposure to the
Information technology industry and mould yourself as a professional. Later in my career I got
promoted as a Junior developer and started working in lot of innovative projects.
<br></br>
<br></br>
My experience in Qburst helped to work on various aspects of the IT industry. Client
management and effective client communications are some of the challenging areas, I got a
handful of experience. Communication within the team and among clients are inevitable for the
successful delivery of a project. Proper client meetings and team internal meetings helped us in
Qburst to excel in these critical phase of Project development. Client demo of the developed
project slices helped us to be inline with the client expectations of our project. Another critical
aspect I got trained was in conduction retrospective meetings within the team. Retrospective
meetings helps you to analyze a sprints development and to brainstorm on the areas of
improvement based on the past performance. These meetings at Qburst helped to understand
about grooming a set of people to adept professionals.

        Personal values distinguishably identifies a person and it defines the daily life of a person. Personal values create the perspective of a person and how determines how he face the various scenarios in the life. I am a optimistic person and strongly believes that if we do our part in smart way then success will definitely follow us. Whenever I approaches a incident, I always tries to figure out the positive part in it and the scope for growth in it, either in a professional or personal way.
I am person who sticks to strong work ethics and always stick on with the deadlines. If something is not going as expected, then I would inform the related persons on the same, in order to avoid the last minute surprises. I always like to take responsibilities and tries my maximum to live up to that. Trust is an inevitable part of me. If someone is trusting you, then you have the responsibility to work and to be truthful to him. Business and everything in life is build on the basics of the trust.
I am always loyal to whoever trusts in me and adaptable to new situation. I believe loyalty, trust, dependability and communication helps to build a great team and these are the base values every team must possess. Every individual is part of the society and to build a great society everyone must give importance to good personal values. A good society can mould the people within that society.

        I have completed bachelors in computer science and post graduation in Information technology business analysis(ITBA). These two courses gave me a great insight of the Information technology and have good base about the computers. ITBA course helped me to go deeper into the business side of IT industry and gain great knowledge in client management and requirement analysis. After completing my bachelors in computer science, I worked as a software developer for about five years. This experience helped me to understand the actual development of the software and how actually things work in a organization. I faced various scenarios during my work experience as  software developer and I could understand what will help to manage a situation better, whether its proper communication, requirement analysis or timely development demonstration. I have a clear insight about what a developer will be looking for to develop a feature of the project or where he needs proper client inputs. Hence, I could act as  perfect bridge between the software developers and client. During my coursework on business analysis, I was able to study deeper based on my past experience with software development.
I am great team player and adept in managing a team. I always give importance to work ethic and proper communication as these two are the most important part of a successful project.
I expect a employee friendly work environment with chances to learn and face challenging situations. I believe in completing work in the smartest way rather than spending hours of time in the orthodox way.

        I love to spend my free time on various type of activities and each of these activities are a learning experience for me. Usually I like to read books during my free time. Reading books help us to gain a deeper view on the specifics of situations, that we may miss while watching a movie. I love watching movies, they helps us to see our society in different perspectives. Music always entertains me and love listening to music. Nowadays, I am trying to learn guitar and it’s an awesome experience for me.
Sports has been my passion since childhood. I play a variety of games, some of them are cricket, badminton, judo, football, table tennis, volleyball etc. Most of the days at evenings after my work, I love to play badminton, it helps me to maintain my physical health and boost sportsmanship. I used to be part of my college badminton team. During my time as a developer at Qburst technologies, the company used to host badminton and volleyball championships among its various branches. I have won badminton championship there and our team were the volleyball champions at Qburst.
I love to check on new technologies during my free time and watch videos on innovative ideas and upcoming technologies like Quantum computing and self driving cars. This helps me to be update with the fast growing tech industry. I love to spend time in social media sites like linkedin, twitter and facebook. Technical discussion sites like stackoverflow and stackexchange also draws my attention. I also used to spend time in open source discussion communities.
