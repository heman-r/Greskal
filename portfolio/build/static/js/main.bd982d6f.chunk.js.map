Developed web applications for business purpose e-commerce systems using Agile\nmethodology. My areas of expertise are JavaScript ( Node.js, Angular JS, React.js), Python, HTML,\nCSS, MongoDB and AWS and I have a keen interest in microservice architecture. I am an energetic, optimistic and self motivated fellow. I have gone through a lot of failures and convoluted scenarios. The most beautiful part of those times is that, I gained new insights from them and it changed my perceptions about life. Innovative ideas pave the path for change in the world, I always try to analyze and approach situations in different ways. Sometimes it may lead to failure, but I always believe in the fact that failures are the basic steps to success.<br></br>\n\nI am a huge fan of Elon Musk and how he brings his innovative ideas to reality. One of his quotes that inspired me is \n“\"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.\"”\nI always try to uphold this motto everyday in my life. The greatest obstacle a person faces is to work on things he wants to grow in a consistent manner. We should always try to find the time to put input towards the goals we want to achieve in our life. I always try to break my long term goals to short milestones, this will help you to learn and enjoy the path you are taking towards your destiny.\n\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n      <section id=\"Education\" className=\"education\">\n        \n        <div className=\"edu-body\">\n        <div className=\"education-head\">\n          Education\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"edu-view\">\n          <div className=\"education-view\">\n            <span className=\"edu-view-bl-1\">\n              Conestoga College, Kitchener\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"edu-year\">\n              2020 - 2021\n            </span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"education-para\">\n            <div className=\"edu-block-1\">\n            <div>Major</div><div>Information Technology Business Analysis</div>\n            </div>\n          \n            <div className=\"edu-block-2\">\n            <div>Coursework</div><div>Project Management, Business process analysis, Effective communication, Requirement analysis</div> \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"edu-view\">\n          <div className=\"education-view\">\n            <span className=\"edu-view-bl-1\">\n            Calicut university\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"edu-year\">\n              2011 - 2015\n            </span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"education-para\">\n            <div className=\"edu-block-1\">\n            <div>Major</div><span>Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering</span>\n            </div>\n          \n            <div className=\"edu-block-2\">\n            <div>Coursework</div><div>Compiler Theory, Data structures and algorithms,\n          Programming languages, Theory of computation</div> \n            </div> \n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        \n\n        <div className=\"edu-view\">\n          <div className=\"education-view\">\n            <span className=\"edu-view-bl-1\">\n            St Thomas HSS Malayattor\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"edu-year\">\n              2009-2011\n            </span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"education-para\">\n            <div className=\"edu-block-1\">\n              <div>\n              Major\n              </div>\n              <div>\n              Higher secondary education in Computer Science\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"edu-block-2\">\n              <div>\n              Coursework\n              </div>\n              <div>\n              Basics of computer science, Programming in C and C++ language\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"experience\" className=\"about-me exp\">\n        <div className=\"about-head\">\n          Experience\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"exp-body\">\n        <div className=\"education-view-1\">\n        <span>Qburst Technologies pvt limited</span>\n        <span className=\"edu-year\">2015-2020</span>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"about-para\">\n        I worked as a software engineer for 5 years at Qbusrst technologies.

Proper client meetings and team internal meetings helped us in\nQburst to excel in these critical phase of Project development. Client demo of the developed\nproject slices helped us to be inline with the client expectations of our project. Another critical\naspect I got trained was in conduction retrospective meetings within the team.

Personal values create the perspective of a person and how determines how he face the various scenarios in the life. I am a optimistic person and strongly believes that if we do our part in smart way then success will definitely follow us. Whenever I approaches a incident, I always tries to figure out the positive part in it and the scope for growth in it, either in a professional or personal way.\nI am person who sticks to strong work ethics and always stick on with the deadlines. If something is not going as expected, then I would inform the related persons on the same, in order to avoid the last minute surprises. I always like to take responsibilities and tries my maximum to live up to that. Trust is an inevitable part of me. If someone is trusting you, then you have the responsibility to work and to be truthful to him. Business and everything in life is build on the basics of the trust.\nI am always loyal to whoever trusts in me and adaptable to new situation. I believe loyalty, trust, dependability and communication helps to build a great team and these are the base values every team must possess. Every individual is part of the society and to build a great society everyone must give importance to good personal values. A good society can mould the people within that society.\n\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n      <section id=\"why-hire-me\" className=\"about-me\">\n        <div className=\"about-head\">\n          Why hire me\n        </div>\n        {/* <div className=\"about-view\">\n          \"Dive deeper, rather than a swim\"\n        </div> */}\n        <div className=\"about-para\">\n          I have an extensivce experience in backend and front end devlopment.\n          I develop scalable and performance oriented applications, that are relaible and dependable.\n          Technology is my passion and i always tries to be upto-date with leading edge tech.\n          I am great team player and adept in managing a team. \n          I always give importance to work ethic and proper communication as these two are the most important part of a successful project.\n          I expect an employee friendly work environment with chances to learn and face challenging situations. \n          I believe in completing work in the smartest way rather than spending hours of time in the orthodox way.\n\n\n        <br></br>I had a keen interest in internal working of an IT organization \n        and i did a Information technology business analysis course, \n        which helped me to go deeper into the business side of IT industry and gain great knowledge in client management and requirement analysis. \n        I have faced various complicated scenarios during my work experience as a software developer and I know how to handle tense situations. \n        I have a clear insight about what a developer needs to develop a feature of the project or where he needs proper client inputs.\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"interest\" className=\"about-me\">\n        <div className=\"about-head\">\n         Interests\n        </div>\n        {/* <div className=\"about-view\">\n          \"Dive deeper, rather than a swim\"\n        </div> */}\n        <div className=\"about-para\">\n        I love to spend my free time on various type of activities and each of these activities are a learning experience for me. Usually I like to read books during my free time. Reading books help us to gain a deeper view on the specifics of situations, that we may miss while watching a movie. I love watching movies, they helps us to see our society in different perspectives. Music always entertains me and love listening to music. Nowadays, I am trying to learn guitar and it’s an awesome experience for me.\nSports has been my passion since childhood. I play a variety of games, some of them are cricket, badminton, judo, football, table tennis, volleyball etc. Most of the days at evenings after my work, I love to play badminton, it helps me to maintain my physical health and boost sportsmanship. I used to be part of my college badminton team. During my time as a developer at Qburst technologies, the company used to host badminton and volleyball championships among its various branches. I have won badminton championship there and our team were the volleyball champions at Qburst.\nI love to check on new technologies during my free time and watch videos on innovative ideas and upcoming technologies like Quantum computing and self driving cars. This helps me to be update with the fast growing tech industry. I love to spend time in social media sites like linkedin, twitter and facebook. Technical discussion sites like stackoverflow and stackexchange also draws my attention. I also used to spend time in open source discussion communities.\n\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","// This optional code is used to register a service worker.\n// register() is not called by default.\n\n// This lets the app load faster on subsequent visits in production, and gives\n// it offline capabilities.
