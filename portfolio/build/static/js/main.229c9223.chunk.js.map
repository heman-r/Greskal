likes to understand and watch things closely. I believe in the fact that we should make our decisions after having a good knowledge about a subject. Meaningful communication always leads to a successful project and I always try to establish the same. I am an energetic, optimistic and self motivated fellow. I have gone through a lot of failures and convoluted scenarios. The most beautiful part of those painful times is that I gained new insights from them and it changed my perceptions about life. Innovative ideas pave the path for change in the world, I always try to analyze and approach situations in different ways. Sometimes it may lead to failure, but I always believe in the fact that failures are the basic steps to success.\n\nI am a huge fan of Elon Musk and how he brings his innovative ideas to reality. One of his quotes that inspired me is \n“\"When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.\"”\nI always try to uphold this motto everyday in my life. The greatest obstacle a person faces is to work on things he wants to grow in a consistent manner. We should always try to find the time to put input towards the goals we want to achieve in our life. I always try to break my long term goals to short milestones, this will help you to learn and enjoy the path you are taking towards your destiny.\n\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n      <section id=\"Education\" className=\"education\">\n        <div className=\"education-head\">\n          Education\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"edu-view\">\n          <div className=\"education-view\">\n            <span className=\"edu-view-bl-1\">\n              Conestoga College, Kitchener\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"edu-year\">\n              2020 - 2021\n            </span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"education-para\">\n            <div className=\"edu-block-1\">\n            <div>Major</div><div>Information Technology Business Analysis</div>\n            </div>\n          \n            <div className=\"edu-block-2\">\n            <div>Coursework</div><div>Project Management, Business process analysis, Effective communication, Requirement analysis</div> \n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className=\"edu-view\">\n          <div className=\"education-view\">\n            <span className=\"edu-view-bl-1\">\n            Calicut university\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"edu-year\">\n              2011 - 2015\n            </span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"education-para\">\n            <div className=\"edu-block-1\">\n            <div>Major</div><span>Bachelors in Computer Science Engineering</span>\n            </div>\n          \n            <div className=\"edu-block-2\">\n            <div>Coursework</div><div>Compiler Theory, Data structures and algorithms,\n          Programming languages, Theory of computation</div> \n            </div> \n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        \n\n        <div className=\"edu-view\">\n          <div className=\"education-view\">\n            <span className=\"edu-view-bl-1\">\n            St Thomas HSS Malayattor\n            </span>\n            <span className=\"edu-year\">\n              2009-2011\n            </span>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"education-para\">\n            <div className=\"edu-block-1\">\n              <div>\n              Major\n              </div>\n              <div>\n              Higher secondary education in Computer Science\n              </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"edu-block-2\">\n              <div>\n              Coursework\n              </div>\n              <div>\n              Basics of computer science, Programming in C and C++ language\n              </div>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"experience\" className=\"about-me exp\">\n        <div className=\"about-head\">\n          Experience\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"exp-body\">\n        <div className=\"education-view-1\">\n        <span>Qburst Technologies pvt limited</span>\n        <span className=\"edu-year\">2015-2020</span>\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"about-para\">\n        I worked as a software engineer for 5 years at Qbusrst technologies.

Small teams always help to get a lot of exposure to the\nInformation technology industry and mould yourself as a professional. Later in my career I got\npromoted as a Junior developer and started working in lot of innovative projects.\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\nMy experience in Qburst helped to work on various aspects of the IT industry. Client\nmanagement and effective client communications are some of the challenging areas, I got a\nhandful of experience. Communication within the team and among clients are inevitable for the\nsuccessful delivery of a project. Proper client meetings and team internal meetings helped us in\nQburst to excel in these critical phase of Project development. Client demo of the developed\nproject slices helped us to be inline with the client expectations of our project. Another critical\naspect I got trained was in conduction retrospective meetings within the team. Retrospective\nmeetings helps you to analyze a sprints development and to brainstorm on the areas of\nimprovement based on the past performance. These meetings at Qburst helped to understand\nabout grooming a set of people to adept professionals.\n        </div>\n        </div>\n        \n      </section>\n\n      <section id=\"projects\" className=\"about-me\">\n        <div className=\"about-head\">\n          Projects\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"about-view\">\n          Mobile SPA EU\n        </div>\n        <div className=\"about-para\">\n        Nowadays mobile web applications is trending among the user communities.
